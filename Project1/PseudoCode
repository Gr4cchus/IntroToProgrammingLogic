#read_in() will read in each line from nyyankees.csv and return it to main() only!
#########################################
Main will call data_process(parameter)
	data_process will take in a list

Read in an item from list
Create a SpaceDelimitedList
While list is not empty
	Each item with , will be object.split()
	Each item with "" will be object.split() #L and R strip will prob be better and \n
  Store processed list as a SpaceDelimitedList

Create a HeaderList
For header in range of SpaceDelimitedList
	Take the indexs of 0-x
		Store as the HeaderList

-
Remove NAME in HeaderList
Insert FNAME at 0 in HeaderList
Insert LNAME at 1 in HeaderList
Insert AVG Column (after H & AB?) in HeaderList
-

Remove the headers in SpaceDelimitedList
	Store as the new SpaceDelimitedList

-
Read in an item from SpaceDelimitedList
While the SpaceDelimitedList is not empty
	Calculate the player's batting average(H/AB) #H/AB = AVG
	Append the batting average back to HeaderList?
-

Concatenate SpaceDelimitedList and HeaderList
	Assign this to a variable named ProcessedList

Return ProcessedList to main which stores it as manipulation
############################################
#write_out() will take the list returned from data_process() and write it to a file
#on disk named NyStats.<Initials>. (append fields with spaces and \n).
